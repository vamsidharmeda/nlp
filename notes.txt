Patient X First Appt CC: My creatinine is high; I need help with my poycystic kidney disease HPI: 40 yo woman who 
was in good health until 4 years ago, when she was advised to get a sonogram given her family history of PCKD.  The 
USG showed multiple B cysts. Her PMD started her on an ARB.  She subsequently began to have several UTIs which 
were treated as an outpt.  She denies hematuria, she has had normal urine output, but she has had B low back and hip 
pain when she sits for a long time.  She has had no LE edema, SOB, pleural effusions.  She had a more serious 
infection of a cyst 3 months ago which cause flank pain, but she improved with outpt antibiotics.  She was told by her 
nephrologist that her creatinine was rising ("around 2") and that she may eventually need dialysis. She moved to the 
USA for multiple reasons, better medical care being one of them.  Her sibling who has no PCKD lives here in the USA. 
ROS: normal menses, breast pain secondary to cysts, no orthopnea/PND/LE edema PMH:as above plus HTN for 4y 
anemia low back pain/hip pain nephrolithiasis X1 breast cyst pneumothorax 2 months ago with chest tube (after breast

patient most likely has autosomal dominant PKD, give the family pattern.  Her risk is elevated due to early age of onset 
and HTN, on the other hand, she has never had gross hematuria.  We also do not know her genotype (PKD 1 has a 
worse prognosis than PKD2)  Blood pressure lowering will benefit this patient, either with ACE or ARB, though sparing 
the glomeruli is not the key intervention.   P:  Labs: Ua, Um, Uprotein, Chem 7, CBC, iron panel, retic     USG imaging

ID Clinic Initial Visit Seen in Clinic 11/19/10 Patient X DOB 7/09/1959 Rehab: Dr. X Spinal cord:  Dr. Y CC:  Nonhealing 
decub, multiple GNR UTI. HPI:  49 yo M paraplegia at L2 from spinal cord injury 2/2 GSW in 1988, neurogenic bowel and 
bladder.  Since then, pt had required multiple tx for R ischical decub and multiple UTIs 1) R ischial decub First tx 
11/2009.  Received oral cipro x 8 weeks, possibly also clinda. Came to an ER once with itchy hives or rash, was told 
was cipro;  however, pt had apparently already been taking for eight weeks. Also ?10-day attempt to treat with Zosyn 
IV at home, but pt c/o fever/chills after every dose. Has been followed here for local wound care.  VNS comes by 2 
days/week, pt changes dressing himself 5 days/week. Pt currently not c/o fever/chills, no pus from wound, scant 
watery yellow drainage.  Feels almost no pain at ulcer due to GSW. 2) Resistant UTIs Pt had had long hx resistant UTIs 
due to straight cath. Wears Texas foley to catch overflow, straight caths self 3-4x/day. Occ has vague lower abd 
pain.  Cannot feel dysuria per se. Complains of dark (not cloudy) malodorous urine approx 2 weeks. Most recent 
admission 9/30/10-10/4/10  had had mult pos Ucx, was admitted for IV abx but admission Ucx actually negative.  D/c 
home off abx. Clinic visit 11/17/10  c/o foul urine x 5 days, Ucx +same resistant E. coli as before Possible bladder 
diverticulum, to see urology next week. Allergies:  Zosyn -> fever/chills after administration History of ciprofloxacin 
allergy highly unlikely, given that pt has taken it for eight weeks (has tolerated imipenem IV at Hosp X) Meds: Neurontin

M paraplegic, neurogenic bowel and bladder, with chronic R ischial osteo and recurrent resistant UTIs. Likely does NOT 
have cipro allergy, since was taking for eight weeks before developed hives. 1)Decub Given pts hx, may have already 
received full oral course attempting to treat. Sueprficial wound swabs likely only indicating colonization, not active 
infection. MRI will likely be c/w osteo for extremely long time, regardless of treatment status. Wound looks excellent, 
well taken care of.  No indication for abx to treat this wound. Recommendation: continue excellent local care 2)UTIs Pt 
suspected to have anatomical reason for colonization (?diverticulum) as well as neurological. Pt colonized with 
resistant E. coli. No fever, no dysuria (although likely cannot feel it), very few WBC in urine given bacterial load.  Also 
except urine to be somewhat dirty due to straight cath. Pt chronically colonized, but will consider trying to sterilizing in 
short term, then suppress in long term. Recommendation:  Will repeat UCX/UA/Umicro, follow-up.  Will consider tx of 
newest bug with oral abx, then collect urine.  Once sterilized, will likely try Vitamin C 500 mg po bid and Hiprex 1 g po 
bid for long-term suppression. Seen and d/w Dr. Y. UA/Umicro/Ucx here Return in 2 weeks. -

6000u TIW). When he was lost to f/u he stopped taking the FVIII as a prophylactic measure and used it as rescue for 
s/s of hemarthrosis. He took his last dose of prophylactic therapy in early Nov.  12/09 he presented to the ER with 
hemarthosis of the L knee (swelling, dec ROM). In the ER he was given 3500 units and d/ced to home. A baseline level 
drawn that day was 0.2%. He followed up on 12/13 and his knee had improved. PMHx: 1) HIV-last followed here in 
2008. 10/08 VL 910copies/ml by ultra PCR (x log 10^3), CD4 >1000 by calculation. Pt had previously been on combivir 
and viracept and had at least one episode of non-compliance (stopped taking meds b/c he was sick of it). State he has 
been followed off therapy for some time, that he has not required therapy and that his VL was starting to increase but 
his CD4 remains high.  He was most recently followed by Dr. X at Hosp y (and prior to that by Dr. Y and Dr. Z in 
Pediatrics at Hosp Y). 2) Hep C ab positive (in 2000), repeat (4/08) negative Soc Hx: lives with parents, + tobacco use

Impression: 22 yo w/ severe hemophilia A and HIV who was followed here as a child, has not followed here in 2 years 
and now wishes to establish all his care back at Hosp X (had problems getting factor ordered from hosp A). 1) Pt 
wishes to re-establish HIV care here at Hosp X, will need to refer to adult clinic. 2) RTC in 3 months 3) Will call and re-
establish prophylactic therapy 25u/kg on M,W, 40 u/kg on F, with random level checked on Monday AM (or as he is an 
adult, consider rescue therapy only) 

Heme Clinic Note PMD Pt seen on 11/23/10 and asked to return 3 weeks later, she did not keep her f/u appointment. Pt 
was referred for evaluation of her anemia. Pt has had a mild normocytic anemia (Hg about 10.2/mcv 82) since 10/07.  
Previous labs at Hosp X in 2002 and 2007 revealed normal CBC.  Work up has included ferritin 40 (7/09), 26 (11/10), 
colonoscopy 7/09 which revealed only a hyperplastic polyp.  An SPEP was sent and the total gamma globulin was 1.9 
(slightly higher than upper limit of normal 1.8), but there was NO MONOCLONAL SPIKE, a UPEP revealed only protein 
(albumin) within the normal range and WITHOUT MONOCLONAL or LIGHT CHAIN SPIKE.  Other data 11/10 retic 1.0, tsh 
1.61, iron 41 & tibc 333 (7/09).  Other data 6-7/10 rf + 33.8, ana negative, anti ena negative, esr 14.   When seen in

Patient Name: Patient X MR: 12/6/10 Medicine Clinic - Initial Visit  81 yo F with: 1. Salivary gland carcinoma, poorly 
differentiated cancer of hard palate T4 LN(+) diagnosed 1997, now metastatic, s/p neoadjuvant RT then maxillectomy 
and septoplasty. Chest CT 11/07 showed a RML lobulated mass 3.9cm, RLL peripheral nodule, and LUL spiculated 
nodule. Biopsy of RML lesion 1/22/08 was similar to that in the palate (basosquamous features)  - Taxotere x5 given 
with decrease in size of LUL and medial nodules, central lung mass  - Lost to f/u in clinic but had multiple admissions for 
neck/ face cellulitis vs dermatitis.  - Chest CT 6/2/09: RML mass 3.8cm (2.5 cm 7/08). 1.6 cm nodule in LUL (previously 
7mm).   Given increase in mass and prior response to Taxotere, she was treated with two more cycles, last 7/29/09, 
but developed peripheral neuropathy. Chemo was held, and plan was for no further treatment unless pt symptomatic. 
She was lost to f/u between 12/09-10/10, family now concerned for chronic cough, weight loss. Pt eats little solid 
food, but able to swallow small pills. 2. Hypothyroidism: first documented in 1999, likely secondary to external radiation 
given for salivary gland ca (less likely Hashimoto's thyroiditis). From UpToDate: A thyroid-destructive effect is seen 
with total external radiation therapy in patients with head and neck cancer. In one series of 155 patients with head and 
neck cancer treated with either radiation alone or with concurrent chemotherapy, the projected incidence of 
hypothyroidism at five and eight years was 48 and 67 percent, respectively, and the median time to develop 
hypothyroidism was 1.4 years (range 0.3 to 7.2 years).  Patient has been treated with varying doses of levoxyl (25 - 
100 mcg), currently taking 50 mcg qd. 3. Otitis, L sided: seen by ENT and prescribed ear drops bid x 10 days

4cm prior). Right apical nodule without change.   Head CT 2/10 Ill-defined lucency of the clivus may reflect osteopenia 
versus metastatic disease, possible maxillary sinus mucosal thickening  Osteoporosis in L-spine and radius by DXA in 
3/10  Plan:  1. Hypothyroidism: currently with target levels of T4 and T3 on current dose of 50 mcg daily (changed 
10/25/10) -- TSH may normalize over next 3 months, will keep levoxyl at current dose for now and recheck TSH, free 
T4 in 4 weeks.  Check anti-TPO antibodies to exclude Hashimoto's, even though likely etiology is external radiation to 
head and neck.  Refer to Thyroid clinic.  2. Osteoporosis: life expenctancy too short to benefit from fosamax per 
Oncology  3. Salivary gland carcinoma: Metastatic disease without significant symptoms. Continue current mgmt per 
Oncology Dr. Apollo. 4. HCM: pt received influenza vaccine from outside source this year  5. RTC 1 month.

Patient X Second Clinic Visit 82 year old woman, a Jehovah's witness, with a history of  SVT rheumatic fever severe 
coronary artery disease severe mitral regurgitation CHF severe refractory anemia  The patient returns today after I 
saw her 3 weeks ago in decompensated CHF (SOB at rest, elevated JVP) and directly admitted her to the hospital. The 
patient's CAD was worked up with a catheterization in 2008: left main of 70%, mid-distal LAD of 75%, RCA 100% and 
left circumflex of 75%.  The pt was admitted on 11/30/10 and was diuresed. Cardiology was consulted regarding the 
possibility of a percutaneous procedure. They felt that the patient would require surgery. CT Surgery was consulted 
and they recommended medical treatment to get her hematocrit up to 30 before she could be considered for surgery. 
The patient's anemia was treated with iron and Aranesp but without any significant rise in her hematocrit during the 
hospital stay. Of note, she also had several runs of SVT during the stay. She was started on digoxin and Diltiazem 
which controlled her SVT well. The pt was lastly found to have a UTI with Trichomonas and Enterobacter Cloacae and 
was treated with Bactrim and Metronidazole orally.  Guaiac negative in the hospital. ROS:  no SOB, able to slowly climb 
4 flights of stairs to her apartment, no CP, 3 pillow orthopnea, improved LE edema, no syncope/falls/lightheadedness.

42mmHg. 4 Left ventricle is hyperkinetic. 5. The left atrium is severely dilated. 6. Right ventricle is normal size and 
systolic function.  A: 82 yo woman with severe anemia with little response to iron/epogen, severe CAD, and CHF 
related to her severe AR. At the moment she appears well compensated on medical therapy. The pt's care has been 
complicated by her Jehovah's Witness beliefs--forbidding valve/CABG surgery and forstalling catheter-based 
approaches.  The first step in offering her choices in interventions is to correct her anemia. P: Anemia: continue iron 
supplementation, pt to receive Aranesp in Heme clinic.  Continue anemia workup: hemolysis panel (though nl bilis), 
consider bone marrow biopsy, consider other w/u for MM, other heme malignancies. Dr. X of Heme to follow CHF/CAD: 
continue current medical regimen for CAD and CHF Only valve repair and revascularization could greatly improve her 
survival--perhaps we can address these options over time.  Dr. Y of Cardiology to follow. HM: Flu shot today.  Defer 
mammogram, FOBT. dispo: pt is only eligible for 9 weeks of VNS services as she has Medicare, not Medicaid.

DOB: 10-27-2003 Dear Dr. X: I had the pleasure of seeing Pt X for a consultation for pulmonary hypertension.  As you 
well know, he is a 7 year-old male with sickle cell disease.  He was prenatally diagnosed at 6 months gestation.  He 
was the full term 8 lb 6 oz product of a normal spontaneous vaginal delivery, and was reportedly well in infancy.  At 
about 1 month of age he had an episode of dehydration and then between 6 months and 2 years of age he had several 
splenic sequestrations and finally had a splenectomy in November of 2004.  He has only had one pain crisis which 
required admission, although he has had several acute chest crises (6-7), which included ICU admissions.  However, 
he has never needed to be intubated for any of these crises.  His last admission was in June of 2010.  He has no other 
known medical problems, but has recently been complaining of more fatigue, dyspnea particularly with running, jogging 
or going up stairs.  He denies any dyspnea with walking flat surfaces.  Overall, he has always been less active than 
his peers.  He does like to swim.  He denies any palpitations, syncope or edema.  He has been on chronic transfusions 
for the past 2 years and his mother reports he has chronic lung disease.  His last transfusion was 5 weeks ago.  He 
used to undergo transfusion every 2 weeks and now has tolerated a wean to every 5 weeks.  With regard to family 
history, there is no family history of sickle cell disease.  By report, his sister has lupus.  He has a 20 year-old sister and 
a 14 year-old brother.  There is no other family history of congenital heart disease, pulmonary hypertension or coronary 
disease.  There is a maternal great-uncle who had underdeveloped lungs and heart problems.  He is currently 59 years 
old.  With regard to surgical history, Joseph had a port-a-cath placed at 13 months, which has never been changed, 
and he had a T & A at 5 years of age for sleep apnea.  His mother denies any snoring at present.  His current 
medications include Pen VK prophylaxis 250 mg po bid and Desferal every 5 days.  He also wears 2.5 liters of oxygen 
as needed, and Xopenex as needed.  By report, he is allergic to Dilaudid as well as latex. On physical exam, he is well 
appearing.  His blood pressure is 92/60 mmHg, pulse 72 bpm, respirations 18 per minute.  His HEENT exam and neck 
exam are normal.  His lungs had good aeration bilaterally.  On cardiac exam, he had a regular rate with normal S1 and 
slightly narrow S2 but which was otherwise normal.  His abdomen was soft without hepatomegaly.  A splenectomy 
scar was well healed.  His extremities were warm with 2+ distal pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema.   Non-
invasive testing was performed.  A 12-lead electrocardiogram demonstrates normal sinus rhythm at 94 beats per 
minute with a normal axis and relatively normal ventricular forces.  There are nonspecific ST-T wave changes in lead 3.  
2-D echo demonstrated normal biventricular function with normal interventricular septal position.  There is very mild 
dilation of the right heart, but there is no significant RVH.  The heart otherwise appears normal.  Cardiopulmonary 
exercise testing was performed.  He walked a total of 498 meters on a 6-minute walk test with a Borg dyspnea score 
of .5.  During cardiopulmonary exercise testing he achieved a peak workload of 40 watts (370redicted) as well as a 
peak VO2 of 21.1 mL/kg/min (640redicted).  End tidal CO2s were relatively normal, as were his VE/VCO2.  Exercise 
was somewhat limited by oxygen delivery capacity secondary to his hemoglobinopathy. In summary, Pt X is a 7 year-
old male with sickle cell disease on chronic transfusion therapy.  
He has had echocardiograms in the past which were suggestive of mild pulmonary hypertension.  The most suspicious 
was just prior to initiating chronic transfusion therapy.  I am somewhat reassured that his echocardiogram and workup 
appear relatively normal at present, with no evidence of significant pulmonary hypertension.  I am attributing this 
improvement to his chronic transfusion therapy.  I would recommend then as you taper the transfusions to every 5 
weeks that we do a follow-up echocardiogram and EKG as well as visit in 6 months to ensure that he has had no 
change in his pulmonary pressures.  I do not feel at this time he needs to be studied invasively with a cardiac 
catheterization, but I do feel he warrants serial follow-up. Thank you for allowing me to partake in the care of this lovely 
young child.  If in fact he does develop more significant pulmonary vascular disease in the future, I would consider 
treatment with a phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitor such as sildenafil.  However, again, at present I feel that it is unlikely that 
pulmonary hypertension is contributing to his symptoms. Please do not hesitate to contact me with any further 
questions.

37 yo woman tranferring primary care; seen previously by nurse practitioner here (1 hour late for visit). Hx:  3 
concerns: 1.	hx/o fibroids, previously followed at NYU Gyn, worried about enlargement and discomfort.  Menstrual 
periods are regular, monthly, but progressively longer and heavier (~ 9 days), and associated with increasingly severe 
cramps.  Helped by Motrin (takes 600, 8-12/day for several days during beginning of period).  Last US apparently here 
in 2009, results below. 2.	hernia left groin since age 20, had lapararoscopy then because of groin pains no 
additional details.  Still has left groin and left lower abdominal pains which she associates with this lump, would like to 
have it removed.  No apparent change in size or appearance. 3.	very tired; always nauseated, especially after 
meals; anorexic; vomits occasionally both after meals and before, no blood; bowel movements nl, not black/tarry, no 
blood; losing weight; was told she had anemia, taking iron and multivitamin supplements PMH:   -	hepatitis B 1987 -

apparently separate subcutaneous firm 2-3 cm nodule just superior to umbilicus, nl bowel sounds.  Left groin with 3x5 
cm oblong rubbery non-tender subcutaneous mass just above the inguinal fold, no change with Valsalva.  Extrs w/o 
cyanosis, clubbing; 1+ dependendt edema; pedal pulses full and symmetric.   LABS (10-10):  CBC nl (Hct 37, MCV 88, 
RDW 16); lytes notable for K 5.1, Cl/CO2 110/19; BUN/Cr 16/1.0, Hep B S,C abs +, HbsAg neg, HCV Ab neg. IMAGING:  
Abd US (4-09, apparently b/o RUQ pain):  mildly enlarged liver, gallbladder sludge, large heterogeneous mass in the 
pelvis likely representing an enlarged fibroid uterus. ASSESSMENT: 1.	Abdominal mass.  Hx/o of fibroids, but extent 
of mass and recent constitutional symptoms very worrisome for malignancy, ? leiomyosarcoma vs. other intrabdominal 
or pelvic tumor.  Will obtain CT abd/pelvis with contrast ASAP.  Check LFTs.  Acetaminophen 500 ii tid and tramadol 50 ii 
tid prn pain, including menstrual discomfort. 2.	Breast mass, ? axillary mass.  Pt reports this noted previously, told 
of fibrocystic ds, although ? larger.  Will arrange diagnostic mammogram. 3.	Left groin mass.  Present for years 
w/o apparent change.  May be simple lipoma and have no relation to other symptoms and abdominal mass; await CT 
imaging. 4.	Nausea/vomiting.  May be due in part to external gastric compression by large abdominal mass.  
Symptoms and hx/o Motrin use also very suspicious for NSAID gastropathy.  Asked to d/c Motrin and all other NSAIDs.  
Start omeprazole 20 qd. 5.	Abnl BMP.  Hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis with mildly increased potassium suggests 
renal tubular dysfunction - ?? ureteral compression and mild obstructive uropathy from abdominal mass.  Await 
imaging, will repeat BMP.  BUN/Cr appear nl, but may be slightly increased for her stature/gender advised copious PO 
liquids for 2 days prior and after CT/contrast.  Will recheck BMP again after procedure. RTC ASAP after CT scan. Add:

Reason for Visit: Evaluation of urinary frequency History of Present Illness: Patient is a 49 year old Nigerian-born male 
who reports that he has had intermittent increased urinary frequency for the past year.  He had an evaluation in 
December that showed leukocytes in his urine but negative culture and no sugar.  His HgbA1c was mildly elevated at 
that time and he was told he had "borderline" diabetes.  Workup at that time showed normal CXR, normal TFTs, LFTs, 
CBC and Chem7, ECG showed frequent APCs and RBBB.  Since then he has had frequent urination, especially at night 
while he is working.  He has occasional need to get up to urinate during his daytime sleep.  He also reports feelings of 
nerves, with his "stomach jumping" but cannot characterize further. Past Medical History: S/P umbilical hernia repair in 
1989 (in Texas); in 1995 he was diagnosed as having "stress"; he was treated for several months with Zoloft and the 
problem resolved.  He was treated for NGU once in the past. Medications: Occassional Advil Adverse reactions: has 
had GI symptoms from aspirin in the past Social History: Patient was born in Nigeria, moved to Texas 19 years ago, 
moved to NY 15 years ago.  He lives alone, has a wife of 6 years and two daughters (1yr and 5yr) living in Nigeria, he 
visits annually; he works at Hosp Y in Building Services, where he does "a lot of lifting".  He does not drink, smoke or 
use drugs. Review of Symptoms: Patient notes many months of intermittent chest pain brought on by stress; he gets 
short of breath when climbing stairs but has essentially unlimited exercise tolerance.  He notes occassional bleeding 
from hemorrhoids, but no diarrhea, constipation, melena or hematochezia.  He fixates on minor events (such as taking a 
small amount of alcohol once many years ago) as things that might have "done him damage", without and clear 
associated symptoms.  After the visit, he reported impotence of over past few years. Exam: General: patient is an 
obese, friendly, talkative male, appears somewhat younger than stated age P: 70 regular; RR: 12; BP: 140/90 bilaterally; 
Wt: 250 Head/Neck: NC/AT, neck supple w/o JVD, nodes or bruit Chest: Clear Heart: RR, split S2, no murmur or extra 
sound Abdomen: obese, old midline hernia scar and old burn scar on LUQ; no mass, tenderness or organomegaly, BS+ 
Genital: no mass, discharge or lesion, no hernia Rectum: no mass, tendernes or hemorrhoids; stool heme negative 
Extremitie: no CCE Impression: 1) Obesity 2) Increased urinary frequency - need to R/O DM and UTI; may be due to 
increased fluid intake 3) Intermittent chest pain - atypical 4) Abnormal heart sounds - possibly due to RBBB 5) RBBB 
and APCs of unclear significance 6) Mild increased BP 7) History of STD 8) Psych: Patient is fixated on many minor 
complaints, acting somewhat inappropriate at times (interrupted my hallway discussion with another patient to tell me 
about impotence, for example), treated in past with Zoloft for "anxiety" 9) S/P Umbilical hernia repair 10) Hemorrhoids 
by history Plan: 1) UA with micro 2) Bloodwork: Chem7, HqbA1c, VDRL 3) F/U with me 1 week; at that time, consider:  -

Reason for visit: General care and referral to dermatology for toenail infection History of Present Illness: Patient is a 53 
year old Turkish male with no significant past medical history, who has noted abnormal toenails fo over ten years.  
They have gradually worsened and he is now seeking dermatollogic advice. Past Medical History: Positive PPDs 
repeatedly over at least the past 8 years, always with negative CXR, attributed to BCG as a child, no treatment given.  
He has a negative colonoscopy circa 2000.  he has been plagued by repeated sinus infections for many years, told in 
Turkey that he has abnormally large sinuses and that no treatment would help him. Allergies: Told of penicillin allergy as 
a child Medications: occassional aspirin and tylenol Social History: Worked as a geophysical engineer in Turkey, came

	Re: Patient X 						DOB: 1-25-1966 Dear Dr. X: I had the pleasure of seeing Pt 
X for a consultation.  As you well know, she is a 44 year-old wheelchair bound woman who has tetralogy of Fallot and 
underwent a Waterston shunt at 3 years of age.  She had an increasing O2 requirement over the past 1-2 years and 
had been getting more short of breath.  She feels better with the oxygen supplementation.  Past history is significant for 
having had congenital Rubella syndrome with associated static encephalopathy, myelomeningocele, neurogenic bladder 
and bowel with prolapsed uterus.  She has been known to have pulmonary hypertension and was referred for a 
consultation.  She is wheelchair bound and it is difficult to obtain a detailed history from her in terms of her symptoms, 
except that she has been more short of breath and is less so with her oxygen.  She denies any peripheral edema or 
syncope, but does occasionally complain of dizziness.  She uses her wheelchair to get around.  She does have 
cyanosis, and does complain of nonspecific joint swelling.  With regard to risk factors for pulmonary hypertension, she 
denies having lived or traveled to high altitude, taken hormone replacement, oral contraceptives, diet pills or tobacco.  
She has no known family history of connective tissue disease, congenital heart disease of coronary disease.  She has 
no known drug allergies and is currently on Digoxin .125 mg po qday, aspirin 81 mg po qday, chlorothiazide 250 mg po 
qday, Colace 100 mg po bid, Flovent 20 mcg one puff bid, insulin 4 units, Lantis at night time, Synthroid .112 mg po 
qday, Lipitor 10 mg po qday, Plavix 75 mg po qday, Singulair 10 mg po qday and Toprol XL 25 mg qday. On physical 
exam, she is wheelchair bound.  Her blood pressure is 92/68 mmHg, pulse 50 bpm, respirations 12 per minute.  Her 
room air saturation is 81% as well as 810n 4 liters of oxygen.  Her chest was clear to auscultation.  On cardiac exam, 
she has a regular rate with normal S1, a single loud S2 with a II-III/VI continuous murmur at the right upper sternal 
border which radiates to the back as well as a II/VI systolic ejection murmur.  Her abdomen was soft without 
hepatosplenomegaly.  Her extremities were significant for 2+ distal pulses with clubbing and cyanosis. A 12-lead 
electrocardiogram demonstrates sinus bradycardia at 48 beats per minute with normal axis, right bundle branch block 
pattern and prominent RV forces.  A 2-D echocardiogram demonstrates moderately decreased  RV function. The LV 
function is also at least moderately  decreased.  The cardiac anatomy demonstrates TOF/ PA with a large malalignment 
VSD and an overriding aorta. Color and pulsed Doppler demonstrate bidirectional shunting across the VSD. There is 
mild TR. with 79 mmHg.  There is mild MR.   There is mild to moderate AI. There is shunt flow seen into the very tiny right 
pulmonary artery.  The left pulmonary artery was unable to be visualized.  There is holodiastolic flow reversal in the 
descending aorta. The images were very technically limited. Tissue Doppler has reversed E'/A' Doppler signals in the 
TV, IVS, and the MV c/w biventricular diastolic dysfunction.  There is a dilated Coronary sinus, however, an L SVC 
was unable to be demonstrated (probably for technical reasons).  Chest x-ray demonstrates a right-sided aortic arch 
with no evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion, effusion or infiltrate.  Cardiomegaly is present.  Her liver profile is 
normal.  Her hemoglobin is 17 gm/dl.  Her TSH is slightly elevated at 4.32 (upper limits of normal in our lab is 4.25).  Her 
iron studies are within normal limits. In summary, Roxanne is a 44 year-old with a history of tetralogy of Fallot, s/p 
Waterston shunt placed, and Eisenmenger syndrome.  After reviewing her data, I think we should give her a trial of the 
oral endothelin-A receptor antagonist sitaxsentan via study protocol.  We have had some patients with Eisenmenger 
syndrome who have improved oxygenation and cardiorespiratory symptoms, even with long-standing disease.  The 
only potential side effects are liver toxicity.  We would then need to follow her liver function tests closely every 2-4 
weeks.  We will need a V/Q scan prior to initiation of this medication, re-assessment of LV function, as well as a 
follow-up visit to rediscuss this with Pt X.  I would also recommend some general measures which we recommend for 
all of our patients with pulmonary hypertension, which include: 1) aggressive treatment of all upper respiratory 
infections with antibiotics to avoid bacterial superinfection, 2) aggressive treatment of all fevers with antipyretics to 
avoid increased metabolic demands on an already compromised cardiorespiratory system, 3) SBE prophylaxis for any 
dental procedures, 4) flu and pneumococcal vaccines prior to the winter season, and 5) oxygen for air travel to avoid 
alveolar hypoxia which may lead to worsening symptoms of pulmonary hypertension.   Thank you for allowing me to 
partake in the care of this patient.  Please do not hesitate to contact me with any further questions. 			
				
														Re:  Patient X	
						DOB: 7-18-1962 Dear Dr. Y: We had the pleasure of seeing Patient X in the 
office on November 16th for consultation.  As you well know, she is a 48 year-old rheumatologist who has an ill-
defined collagen vascular disorder.  However, she has had no cardiopulmonary symptoms until the past several weeks 
when she noted several episodes of chest pain, both at rest as well as with exertion, as well as dyspnea with 
exertion.  She therefore appropriately underwent noninvasive evaluation including a surface electrocardiogram as well 
as a 2-dimensional echocardiogram, which raised the possibility of Patient X having pulmonary hypertension, with an 
estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure of 45 mmHg assuming a mean right atrial pressure of 10 mmHg.  From a 
cardiopulmonary standpoint, other than the symptoms above, she has no history of syncope/near syncope/dizziness, 
cough or sneeze-induced symptoms, peripheral edema except for trace peripheral edema which she reports thinks 
secondary to her Procardia therapy, no significant complaints of nausea/vomiting, significant palpitations, cyanosis or 
pallor, hemoptysis or frequent epistaxis.  She sleeps comfortably on one pillow.  She does have a history of snoring for 
the past several years.  Family history is unremarkable except for a maternal cousin having Raynaud's and her father 
having systemic hypertension.   Past medical history reveals that Patient X was a healthy young woman until her 
internship and residency, during which time in 1983 she contracted non A/non B/non C hepatitis secondary to a needle 
stick with transaminases increasing to the thousands and a bilirubin increasing to 27.  She subsequently underwent a 
liver biopsy, which demonstrated chronic bridging hepatitis which resolved over time without treatment.  She 
subsequently had an episode of colitis, and in 1995 was diagnosed with serologic negative arthritis when she 
presented with bilateral knee effusions.  She subsequently developed hemolytic anemia with mononucleosis, and more 
recently had another episode of significant anemia with a workup that was unremarkable despite the history most 
consistent with a chronic autoimmune hemolysis.  Patient X was diagnosed with Raynaud's approximately 4 years ago 
and 2 years ago was diagnosed has having esophageal dysphasia and dysmotility.  Patient X also has had several 
episodes of digital ischemia. Past medical history reveals that she was a 6 lb 12 oz product of a full-term uncomplicated 
pregnancy delivered to a Gravida 3 Para 2 41 year-old Caucasian female, with no known neonatal problems.  As a 
child, she had several episodes that were perhaps a malar rash as well as an episode of ankle pain and subsequently 
an ill-defined febrile illness.  She has no know allergies to medications, has never had a blood transfusion, has never 
lived at high altitude, has never used diet pills, only used birth control pills for several weeks, has never smoked, drinks 
socially, is a HIV negative and has never used intravenous drugs.  She has been pregnant on three occasions; has 
two healthy children who are 12 and 17 years of age and had one voluntary termination. Her current medical regimen 
includes: Procardia XL 60 mg po qd, Plaquenil 400 mg qd, Nexium 40 mg qd, aspirin 81 mg qd, Folate 1 mg qd, Xanax 
prn, and Mobic 7.5 mg bid. On physical examination, Patient X was acyanotic and in no acute distress.  Heart rate was 
72 and regular, respiratory rate 14 without distress, and blood pressure 120/80 in the right arm which was easily 
audible.  Chest exam was clear and unremarkable.  Cardiovascular exam revealed a regular rhythm with a quiet 
precordium, a normal S1, an unremarkable S2 with no significant murmur appreciated.  Examination of her abdomen and 
extremities was unremarkable. 2-dimensional echocardiography revealed normal right and left ventricular systolic 
function, no significant dilatation of the right heart or significant right ventricular hypertrophy, a straight interatrial 
septum, a normally committed interventricular septum to the left ventricle, trace tricuspid regurgitation with an estimated 
tricuspid regurgitant jet of 28 mmHg, trivial mitral regurgitation with no evidence of mitral valve prolapse, no evidence of 
left ventricular diastolic dysfunction, although a question of right ventricular diastolic dysfunction.  Unfortunately, her 
echo windows were less than ideal.  Surface electrocardiogram revealed a normal sinus rhythm with a normal axis, 
and was within normal limits.  Pulmonary function studies also were fairly unremarkable except for a mild decreased 
DLCO of 66% with a KCO of 72%.  Cardiopulmonary exercise testing, although demonstrating only 660redicted peak 
VO2 and 710redicted peak workload, her end tidal CO2 and VE/VCO2 were both normal, which is very consistent with 
no evidence of clinically significant pulmonary hypertension. As I discussed with Dr. Kitsis and her husband, she has 
no evidence by noninvasive evaluation of clinically significant pulmonary hypertension.  However, with her having an 
ill-defined connective tissue disease, we plan to have Patient X  undergo a stress echocardiogram to rule out exercise-
induced pulmonary hypertension.  Assuming that that is unremarkable, our recommendation is to see Patient X on a 
yearly basis for follow-up echocardiography, or more frequent if needed.  We also will recommend follow-up 
cardiopulmonary exercise testing as well as consideration of right heart catheterization at rest as well as with exercise 
and acute vasodilator drug testing if any questions arise in the future with regard to change in symptoms or 
noninvasive studies. Please do not hesitate to contact us at any time if questions or problems arise with Dr. X that we 
may be of assistance with.

52 year old man with h/o ischemic CMP, EF 20% who presents after recently being hospitalized with NSTEMI. HPI: Pt 
admitted to HOSPITAL X 12/16. Pt c/o orthopnea, increasing SOB, and cough initially diagnosed as bronchitis. He was 
referred to a local ER and was found to have a troponin leak of Troponin 9 and CMP diagnosed by CXR an exam. He 
underwent echo which showed an EF 25%. Also, had cath which showed LAD 50%, LCx 50%, RCA 100%. 
Apparently, for unclear reasons, he was scheduled for CABG, but intraop had TEE which showed EF10%. Surgery 
was aborted and he was referred to HOSPITAL X for heart transplant evaluation.  At HOSPITAL X he did well. His cath 
films were reviewed and did not show acute indication for CABG. He underwent stress test which showed a fixed 
inferolat defect. His echo showed EF 20%. He was euvolemic. He also underwent RHC which showed normal filling 
pressures but low CI - 1.2 and low PA sat of 62%. Overall, he was walking about and feeling well and transplant 
evaluation was deferred in favor of pursuing medical therapy right now. The patient returns to clinic today overall doing 
quite well. He was slightly SOB and had some coughing and bronchitis like symptoms again at night. Otherwise no 
swelling, weight gain, SOB, or LH. No CP. PMH: 1. Ischemic CMP - EF 20% 2. NIDDM - newly diagnosed 3. Hepatitis B in

scleroderma. No relief with NSAID's. Prednisone given, then developed acute manic episode. Sent to pain clinic, seen 
once, recommended muscle relaxant but was unable to use because of conflict with bipolar medicines. Prescribed 
opiates (Zydone) by PMD; used them much more rapidly than prescribed (pt. reports taking qid, label says maximum 
dose is tid); pain clinic recommended giving limited amounts of short-acting opiates and a long-acting pain medicine 
such as transdermal fentanyl, which patient says he does not like. Last pain clinic visit 3 months ago, requests referral 
to pain clinic. U tox positive for amphetamines x2, most recently 11/10.  Pt. went to patient relations to complain that Dr. 
Y discriminated against him and managed his pain improperly. Dr. Y says that he has discharged the patient from his 
clinic.  Has usual level of chronic pain now, which he considers excessive. He has no more Zydone; last Zydone 5 
days ago. Pain is predominantly constant in face and knees bilaterally, but covers entire body. Able to complete his 
daily activities, but reports that the pain brings fatigue. Partial relief with Tylenol and ibuprofen. Reports history of opiate 
withdrawal, and says that he thinks in withdrawal now.  Denies any change in pain or in general health recently.

PAIN - Likely in opiate withdrawal. Refer to buprenorphine (opioid withdrawal) clinic. Will refill Zydone now x1 to treat 
withdrawal until next appointment. Avoid NSAID's due to history of elevated creatinine. DDx of pain syndrome may 
include musculoskeletal pathology--will continue to work up underlying etiology of pain, but will first stabilize opiate 
withdrawal symptoms.  HTN - Uncontrolled. DDx untreated pain v. improperly treated essential HTN v. secondary HTN.
